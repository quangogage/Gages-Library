# Gages-Library
A library of small, useful functions that I have been collecting and storing as I learn.

## Install
There are two options you have for installing this library:

**1. NPM**

Install this repository as a node package:

`npm install git+ssh://git@github.com/quangogage/Gages-Library.git`

**2. .ZIP**

Download this directory as a ZIP file and place it in your project.

## Use
`import GageLib from "Gages-Library";`

## Documentation
*I am hoping to create a list of this library's complete funcionality in the future, but for now..*

This library is broken up into seperate modules - each containing useful functionality relative to it's name, referenced via `GageLib.nameofmodule`. Right now there are only 4 modules.

* *Array* - `GageLib.array`
* *Device* - `GageLib.device`
* *Math* - `GageLib.math`
* *String* - `GageLib.string`
